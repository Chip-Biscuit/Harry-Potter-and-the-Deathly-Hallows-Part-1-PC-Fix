# Instructions
Go to releases and download the latest of the following fixes hp7fix.zip, hp7fixNOTOGGLE.zip, hp7fixOriginalFOV.zip or hp7fixOriginalFovNOTOGGLE.zip, depending on which version you want to use.

For each of the fixes extract the d3d9.dll and d3d9.ini files into your game folder next to the hp7.exe file and you are good to go!

You can edit the settings you wish to use in the d3d9.ini file.

# Aspect Ratio
The default for aspect ratio is (0) which is 16:9, choose out of the other aspect ratios available to use by changing (0) to the number that’s correct for you.

# FPS
The default for FPS is (60) you can change it as you wish or fully uncap it with (0) with the FPSLimit option in the d3d9.ini file.

There are two versions of the FPS fix to use. The hp7fixNOTOGGLE.zip you just set an FPS you wish to use, and the game will run at that FPS during gameplay. The menus will be sped up, however, cutscenes will not be affected and remain at correct speed.

The other fix hp7fix.zip you set the FPS you wish to use and then in game you use the toggle key ‘9’ to toggle between your chosen FPS and the original games 30fps.

# FOV
There are two versions of the FOV fix to use. The hp7fix.zip and hp7fixNOTOGGLE.zip both have a set zoomed out FOV on by default.

The other fixes hp7fixOriginalFOV.zip and hp7fixOriginalFovNOTOGGLE.zip both use the original games FOV by default.

Choose the fix that applies to how you wish to play the game.
